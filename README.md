# Clicky Game

React based memory game

### Overview

Clicky is a React app based on a traditional memory game. Instead of flipping over cards and remembering where their match is the user clicks on individual cards, the cards are reshuffled, and then the user must remember which cards they previously clicked on. This game takes advantage of React's ability to manage state.
